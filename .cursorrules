# Comment Style Guidelines

## Core Principles

Comments should focus on **what** the code does, not **why** it was written that way or how it evolved. All comments must be utility-focused and describe the current state of the codebase only.

## Rules

### ✅ DO: Write Utility-Focused Comments

Comments should explain:
- What a function or block of code does
- What parameters mean
- What values represent
- Algorithm steps or data structures

**Good Examples:**
```javascript
// Apply One Euro Filter to each component
const filteredPos = state.positionFilter.filter(now, [x, y, z]);

// Check for outliers before filtering
if (this.config.outlierDetectionEnabled && state.previousMatrix) {
  // ...
}

// Remove old data points
const cutoff = now - this.config.historyDuration;

// Limit the number of querypoints processed if there are too many
if (querypoints.length > MAX_QUERYPOINTS) {
  // ...
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Write Historical or Contextual Comments

Never include:
- References to previous implementations ("replaces", "replaced", "old", "previous", "earlier", "before")
- Explanations of why code was changed
- Notes about code evolution or migration
- References to earlier versions

**Bad Examples:**
```javascript
// This replaces the custom implementation with well-tested packages
// Note: Filtering is now handled by the matrix post-processor, not here
// Phase 2 Optimization: Reduce octaves for very large images
// Note: We need to keep final tensors alive, so we clone them outside tidy()
```

### ❌ DON'T: Write Performance Explanations

Never include:
- Comments about optimization, performance, efficiency
- Explanations of why code is fast or slow
- Notes about bottlenecks or performance characteristics
- Comparisons of different approaches' performance

**Bad Examples:**
```javascript
// Use slice() for efficient copy
// More efficient than multiple shifts
// Performance profiling - log slow frames
// This loop is the performance bottleneck
// faster to do it in CPU
// better performance
```

### ❌ DON'T: Write TODO/FIXME Comments

Remove all TODO and FIXME comments. If something needs to be done, create an issue or implement it.

**Bad Examples:**
```javascript
// TODO: optimize median
// TODO: better compression method
// FIXME: handle edge case
```

### ❌ DON'T: Write Explanatory "Why" Comments

Avoid comments that explain:
- Why code is structured a certain way
- Why a workaround exists
- Why a decision was made
- Rationale or reasoning

**Bad Examples:**
```javascript
// Note: anchorManager persists across restarts (created in constructor)
// This prevents the outlier from contaminating the filter
// If divinator fails, fall back to simple threshold
// We manually added a single space to get around the regex replacement
```

### ❌ DON'T: Write Comparison Comments

Never compare approaches or mention alternatives:
- "better than X"
- "instead of Y"
- "more X than Y"

**Bad Examples:**
```javascript
// simpler version of upsampling. better performance
// more efficient than multiple shifts
// better memory management
```

## Acceptable Comment Types

### Function/Class Documentation
```javascript
/**
 * Matrix Post-Processor
 * 
 * Applies One Euro Filter for adaptive smoothing (position, rotation, scale)
 * and uses Divinator for outlier detection (Z-score, Modified Z-score, IQR)
 */
```

### Parameter/Value Clarification
```javascript
filterMinCF: config.filterMinCF ?? 0.001,  // Base cutoff frequency (Hz)
outlierMethod: config.outlierMethod ?? 'zScore',  // 'zScore', 'modifiedZScore', 'iqr'
```

### Algorithm Steps
```javascript
// Calculate deltas for outlier detection
// Add to history
// Apply One Euro Filter to each component
```

### Data Structure Description
```javascript
// Per-target state
this.targetStates = new Map();

// Array of position delta magnitudes
positionDeltaHistory: [],
```

## Summary

**Good comments answer:** "What does this do?"
**Bad comments answer:** "Why is this here?" or "How did this evolve?"

Focus on the present state of the code, not its history or performance characteristics.
